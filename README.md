DESCRIPTION : 
          This software computes any given digital circuit.It contains basic as well as universal gates.If the output of the 
          circuit is 0 the color of the output box changes from white to red.If the output is 1 it changes from white to green.
          In case of invalid inputs (when inputs 0 or 1 are not given i.e the circuit is incomplete),  the color of the output
          changes from white to sky blue.
          It has a movable toolbox.
          A dialog box appears when no output box is selected or more than one output boxs are selected.
          The same window can be reused again and again for different circuits using the clear option.
          The window can be minimized and maximized.
          The window can also be closed by pressing ESC key.
